# What is a Sybil attack?

A Sybil attack is a kind of security threat on an online system where one person tries to take over the network by creating multiple accounts, nodes, or computers. This can be as simple as one person creating multiple social media accounts. But in the world of cryptocurrencies, a more relevant example is where somebody runs multiple nodes on a blockchain network. The word “Sybil” in the name comes from a case study about a woman named Sybil Dorsett, who was treated for Dissociative Identity Disorder – also called Multiple Personality Disorder.
