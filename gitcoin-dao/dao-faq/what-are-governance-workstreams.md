# What are governance workstreams?

These are working groups created around objectives.\
At the start four workstreams have been proposed:

* Public Goods Funding
* Fraud Defence & Detection (FDD)
* Decentralize Gitcoin (dGitcoin)
* Moonshot Collective (MC)
* Memes Merchandise and Marketing (MMM)

Workstreams will be created/archived as community Stewards see fit.\
For a larger discussion around Stewards and workstreams, please visit [gov.gitcoin.co](http://gov.gitcoin.co).
