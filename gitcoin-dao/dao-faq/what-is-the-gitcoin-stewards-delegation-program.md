# What is the Gitcoin Stewards Delegation Program?

So far one of the biggest challenges of DAO governance is maintaining an active community, which is crucial for legitimacy. To that end, Gitcoin is launching a liquid democracy through a Stewardship Delegation program. How it works:

GTC holders have voting rights proportional to the amount of tokens they hold. They may assign their voting rights to community Stewards to vote on their behalf, without giving up their tokens

Stewards are active community members who participate in governance. Their influence is directly determined by the community. The more voting rights assigned to them, the more trust the community has in their stewardship.

Some of Ethereumâ€™s most trusted members have volunteered to be the first Gitcoin Stewards, but anyone may become a Steward simply by accepting voting rights.
