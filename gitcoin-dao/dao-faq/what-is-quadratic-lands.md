# What is Quadratic Lands?

Quadratic Lands is the destination we hope to bring the world to:

1. There are numerous opportunities to create financial sovereignty while working side-by-side with people who share similar values.
2. Individuals have the sovereignty to make their own choices, but incentives are aligned for cooperation that generates both individual and community benefit.
3. The economic infrastructure is a set of economic games with transparent rules that cannot be changed without community consent.
4. Because of the composability of blockchain-based systems, the surface area of opportunity will exponentially grow as the tools compound upon each other.

We long to see the Quadratic Lands. Letâ€™s go there together!
