# Quadratic Lands Token Distribution web3 support- Signed Message Vote

If you choose to not delegate your voting power to a steward \(power to the people FTW!\) you will be asked to help chart the future of Gitcoin by proving feedback on the development road map.

You will be prompted to sign a message with your active Ethereum account to solidify your preference. This signed message does not require any gas fees and is not being broadcast on-chain for now.

While it's possible that Gitcoin could use these signed messages as a foundation for a future airdrop or something, for now, we're just collecting these votes up to help us better understand what direction the Gitcoin community would like to see Gitcoin go.
