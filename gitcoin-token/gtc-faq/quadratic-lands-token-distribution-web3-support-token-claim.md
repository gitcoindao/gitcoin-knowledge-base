# Quadratic Lands Token Distribution web3 support- Token Claim

 After completing the first two missions \(1-proof of knowledge and 2- proof of use\) eligible users will arrive at the third mission, proof of receive.

When you click `claim` in the receive mission, you will be prompted to broadcast a transaction to the Gitcoin Token Distribution contract.

If you are having issues with your token claim please here are a few things to check/confirm:

1. your wallet is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet
2. you don't have any old/stale transactions pending transactions on your account
3. you have enough Ethereum in your account to cover the gas fees
