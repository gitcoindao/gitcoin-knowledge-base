# Why is Gitcoin launching a token?

The short answer is we know we need to decentralize, and GTC is the best way to do that.  
Increasingly, more people and projects are using Gitcoin to build and fund digital public goods, and as Gitcoin becomes more popular we are faced with governance questions.

We do not want to be a centralized arbiter, making decisions best left to the community.  
So we launched GTC to allow the community to actively participate in governing Gitcoin.
