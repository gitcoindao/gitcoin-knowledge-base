# Why donâ€™t I have tokens?

As part of the Gitcoin token launch on May 25, 2021, GTC was allocated to people who participated in Gitcoin grants, hackathons, bounties, or KERNEL prior to April 1, 2021. If you fit that criteria and did not receive GTC, [please fill out this form](https://forms.gle/btrX6ny4K6YBuJp3A) and a member of the Gitcoin Team look into it for you.

At the time of token launch \(5/25/2021\), there are three different ways to see/know if you are eligible for the airdrop.

1. The [Gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co/) landing page will show that you have a claim available in the banner.
2. You will see a message on the [Quadratic Lands Mission](http://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/mission) page:

> Complete all 3 missions to receive your tokens.

1. The [Quadratic Lands](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands) landing page will show a claim total in the navigation bar.

If you think you should be eligible for the airdrop, but are not seeing your claim eligibility please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/btrX6ny4K6YBuJp3A).
