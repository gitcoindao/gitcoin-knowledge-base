# Quadratic Lands Token Distribution web3 support-Delegate Voting Power

After you've successfully claimed your airdrop \(or even if a friend sent you tokens and/or you acquired them elsewhere you can delegate your voting power using the [`Stewards interface`](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/stewards) in the Quadratic Lands [üó≥Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/ballot-box-with-ballot/)

This is a relatively straightforward web3 interaction in which you will call the `delegate` function on the **GTC token contract** [`0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163).  
  
If you're having issues delegating through the Quadratic Lands UI you can also try delegating voting power using our \[Tally interface\]\(need production link\) or even with [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f#writeContract).
