# Welcome to Gitcoin

### Mission First

The first thing to know about Gitcoin is that we are mission first. [Our mission](https://gitcoin.co/mission) is to build and fund digital public goods. We believe that Open Source Software is a digital public good that creates $400bn/year in value, but that creators of OSS don’t have great ways to monetize their work on this digital infrastructure. Our goal is to correct this asymmetry

### How we support our mission.

Gitcoin is community first, and our software products a double sided market that connects digital creatives to the people who want to fund their work.\
And visa versa. So far [we’ve created $35mm worth of funding for OSS devs](https://gitcoin.co/results).\
Specifically, the way we do that is:

1. Giving members opportunities to [earn](https://gitcoin.co/earn).
2. Giving members opportunities to [learn](https://gitcoin.co/learn).
3. Giving members opportunities to [connect with one another & prospective career opportunities](https://gitcoin.co/connect).

**How do we do that?**

1. [Bounties](https://gitcoin.co/bounties/contributor) - gig-based work for web3 projects.
2. [Hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons) - Build w the coolest web3 projects.
3. [Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants) - Crowdfunding for Open Source.
4. [KERNEL](http://kernel.community) - A web3-native, community centric accelerator.
5. [tip.party](https://tip.party) - a small, modular tool for engaging people for showing up.
6. [Quadratic Diplomacy](https://quadraticdiplomacy.com) - a decentralized tool for engaging contributors.

### The DAO that governs Gitcoin

In order to make sure that Gitcoin is serving its mission and community first, Gitcoin is governed by the community. In May 2021, [GTC was released](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/). GTC is a governance token with no economic value that governs Gitcoin Grants + GitcoinDAO.

There are three important concepts to know to understand how to interact with GitcoinDAO.

1. Most of the action happens on [discord](https://gitcoin.co/discord), [gov.gitcoin.co](https://gov.gitcoin.co), or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gitcoin)
2. [Stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) are ultimately responsible for governing GitcoinDAO.
3. Workstreams are the primary mechanism through which work is organized in the DAO.

#### DAO Workstreams

1. [Moonshot Collective](https://www.notion.so/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f) is the DAO rapid prototyping workstream
2. [Public Goods](https://www.notion.so/Public-Goods-80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60) is focused on our mission of funding public goods.
3. [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://www.notion.so/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae) is in charge of preventing fraud on Gitcoin Grants.
4. [Decentralize-gitcoin](https://www.notion.so/dGrants-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3) is the mechanism through which Gitcoin is progressively decentralizing.
5. [Memes, Merch, & Marketing](https://www.notion.so/Merch-Memes-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8) is the DAO marketing division.

#### DAO’s Quarterly Cadence

Gitcoin operates in a quarterly cadence. Every quarter, the Gitcoin ecosystem revolves around a quarterly stacked event - a combination Gitcoin Grants round, Hackathon, and KERNEL block - where millions of \$$$ of funding are deployed to the community. Typically a quarter looks like this:

1. Plan for quarterly stacked event.
2. Execute quarterly stacked event.
3. Learn from the quarterly stacked event.
4. Repeat

The next quarterly event is GR12 starting in December 2021.

### DAO KPIs

Right now the DAO is focused on:

1. Creating more ecosystem impact (measured in \$$$ distributed to devs)
2. Decentralizing Gitcoin.

[Ongoing discussions on these KPIs here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/what-are-the-kpis-that-gitcoindao-optimizes-for/8497):

## Testimonials

> I LOVE IT…The community has been outstanding. I have made contact outside of slack w a couple of people. William Schwab was kind enough to ZOOM w me for an hour and tell me his story, letme pick his brain, and as he shared some valuable resources with me. - John Wilkinson

> KERNEL is the greatest thing to ever happen to my crypto/business/personal life. I have made plenty of new friends, connected with people who believe in me and want to work together on other projects, and of course learned a lot from other seedlings, mentors and speakers. - Ethan Chiasson

> Gitcoin gave me the first break into Ethereum and the crypto space. It helped me find bounties that I could work on and get paid in crypto. After my first ever bounty I got paid a lot and I felt euphoric. - Sebastian TF

> I am amazed on a daily basis at the incredible projects and communities in this space. The Gitcoin team and quadratic funding is an invaluable catalyst to bring it all to fruition. Thank you! - Hishamaru Konkon

> Gitcoin grants quadratic funding is not just for funds allocation, it’s also a great signaling tool! For the last few rounds, going to [Grants | Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) has led me to discover a lot of really cool Ethereum projects I previously did not know about. - Vitalik Buterin

> What Gitcoin is doing with public goods funding is absolutely incredible. Nothing but respect to the team and the larger community for the contributions made. - Frobo

> Thanks to [@gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/gitcoin) it has helped us to discover our earliest talent and supercharged @KodaDot development. - Matej

> People ask me all the time how I got into Solidity and NFT dev. The answer is [@gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/gitcoin)! Beginning of the year I just started doing bounties for a bunch of different projects (@synthetix\_io @akashnet\_ @SovrynBTC etc) and found the NFT ones were my fave. Such a good way to learn! - sarasioux.eth
