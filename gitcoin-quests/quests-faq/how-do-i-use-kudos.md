# How do I use kudos ?

**What are Kudos?**

Kudos are an amazing and innovative way to show appreciation and build relationships, think of it as a token of appreciation or a sticker signifying a great job. Additionally, It's also a way to showcase special skills that a member might have, such as Pythonista, or Design Star. Kudos tokens can be bought and sold on the Kudos Marketplace.

**Minting Kudos**

Minting Kudos is a great way to represent your brand, engage a community, and create rewards for desired actions. This can be done rather easily by providing information and creating a piece of artwork relating to the Kudo in the SVG file format. Alternatively, you can submit a request to have someone create the artwork on your behalf.

Kudos can be sent to you as a gift by other Gitcoin members. They can also be purchased with ETH in the Kudos marketplace. Lastly, Kudos may be awarded to Gitcoin Quest conquistadors.
