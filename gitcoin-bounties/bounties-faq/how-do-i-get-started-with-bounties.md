**Contributor Work Flow**  
------------------

-  Optional: Set search criteria on the left side of the screen \(default is mainnet / open issues\).  
-  Select a bounty of interest.  
-  Examine the bounty specifications to ensure a good fit for your skill level.

-  Click on "Express Interest" and give a descriptive summary of how you plan to work on the issue.  
-  For permissionless bounties you can begin work, for approval required bounties you must wait to be notified that you are approved to work on the bounty.  You will get a platform notification and an email.  
-  When work is completed, submit the work by a pull request on the bounty Github repository.  Copy the URL for the pull request.  
-  Return to the Github bounty page and select "Submit Work".  
-  Paste the pull request URL into the PR field, accept the terms, and submit the bounty.

-  The funder may provide feedback in the Github repository for some changes to be made prior to acceptance, check back to the pull request frequently.  
-  Payout is made once the bounty is satisfied.  Allow one to two weeks for a funder response.
