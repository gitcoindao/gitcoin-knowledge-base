# What's Quadratic Funding?

**The QF mechanism is a concrete proposal for turning your small donations into something much larger. It requires a simple formula to achieve this goal.**

**Crowdfund individual donations towards open source projects \(try to have the maximum of contributors, it's the number of participants that counts, not the amount of contribution\) . 2- A match from governments, grant programs, or private philanthropists \(offered by sponsors/donors for the grant's round fund\).**
