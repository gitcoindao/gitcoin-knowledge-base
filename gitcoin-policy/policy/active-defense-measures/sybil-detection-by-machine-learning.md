# Sybil Detection by Machine Learning

#### Machine Learning Flagging & Community Review Process

**Our Machine Learning Flagging & Community Review Process is designed to prevent sybil attacks.**

In addition to the proactive measures above, we have been working with BlockScience on a reactive machine learning pipeline that gives a score to each contribution, and informs the community stewards what contributions to look out for.

BlockScience [has been posting on the Gitcoin blog](https://gitcoin.co/blog) with details about what theyâ€™ve been working on, and will be posting a blog post about this pipeline as it develops.
