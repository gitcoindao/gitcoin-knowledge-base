# User Disputes, Sanctions, and Appeals

There isn't currently a public oversight page for user sanctions due to PII data & potential vulnerabilities.

The review of User sanctions is done by the [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://www.notion.so/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae) workstream of GitcoinDAO.

Any user may appeal their situation in the Gitcoin-Disputes Discord channel.
