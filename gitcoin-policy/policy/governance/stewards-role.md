# Stewards Role

The Gitcoin Governance ecosystem is a delegated voting system \(liquid democracy\) which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to someone else. Community members who have had tokens delegated to them are Stewards, and may vote in on/off chain governance proposals. Token holders may delegate their voting power to themselves if they wish to participate as Stewards. Stewards who alone or with a group meet quorum \(1mm token supply\) may submit governance proposals that call for a vote.
