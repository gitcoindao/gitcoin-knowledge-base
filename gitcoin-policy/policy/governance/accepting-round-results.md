# Accepting Round Results

Gitcoin uses quadratic funding to determine matching pool allocation to individual grants. This is a combination of the Quadratic Funding Algorithm, Pairwise matching, and Trust Bonus. But ultimately ratifying the round payouts is governed by the Community Stewards through a governance proposal and Snapshot vote. The payout transaction is then initiated by the multisig holders. In the future, the ratification vote will occur on-chain, and will trigger the payout transaction directly from the DAOâ€™s treasury.
