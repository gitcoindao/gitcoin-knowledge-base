# GitcoinDAO Appeal Group

Gitcoin has created a group of talented volunteers qualified and motivated to hear and decide appeals. It is called the GitcoinDAO Appeal Group (GDAG). Every person in the GDAG has been selected due to their expertise and/or experience in the Gitcoin Grants Program and/or anti-fraud training and/or legal expertise. The GDAG maintains a roster of about fifteen to thirty members. Until a spokesperson for the GDAG is identified the FDD Policy group shall relay messages and information to/from the GDAG.

When an appeal is requested the GDAG will randomly choose three members to hear and decide on the appeal. After considering evidence provided by the Appellant, the GDAG will vote and a simple majority (two out of three) shall determine the success of the appeal.

The GDAG shall communicate the result of the appeal to the Gitcoin Grant Approval group first, then to the Appellant, and lastly shall post the result in the FDD all-contributors channel and the public grant-approvals channel in the Gitcoin Discord Server.

While Gitcoin strives to complete the appeal process within seven days, occasionally unforeseen circumstances extend the duration.
