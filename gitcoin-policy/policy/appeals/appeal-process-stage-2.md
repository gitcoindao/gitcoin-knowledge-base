# Appeal Process - Stage 2

\*\*\* WORK IN PROGRESS \*\*\*

Second stage appeals are carried out externally to Gitcoin to ensure the utmost levels of objectivity and neutrality.  External conflict resolution platforms like Celeste, Aragon Court, and Kleros all have the ability to process Gitcoin grant appeals with a little bit of customization.  GitcoinDao is integrating Celeste for a second stage to the appeal process.
