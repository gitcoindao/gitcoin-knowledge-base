# Appeal Process - Stage 2

\*\*\* WORK IN PROGRESS \*\*\*

Second stage appeals are carried out externally to Gitcoin to ensure maximum credible neutrality.  External conflict resolution platforms like Celeste, Aragon Court, and Kleros all have the ability to process Gitcoin grant appeals with a bit of customization. GitcoinDao is actively working to create an appeal process through a decentralized court-like system.  In the future these same system may also process interpersonal conflicts and or problems within the dao, like constitution violations.
