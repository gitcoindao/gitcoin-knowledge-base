# Introduction to Appeals

In efforts to ensure everybody gets treated fairly the GitcoinDAO offers appeal processes in various situations.  For example, after the GitcoinDAO decides to punish a member for breaking a rule.  Or when a grant applicant believes they have been wrongly excluded from funding eligibility.  In the future, it is possible new unforeseen areas will appear that also require access to a credibly neutral appeal system.&#x20;

&#x20;The GitcoinDAO Fraud Detection & Defence Appeals Processes shall grow and adapt as required to protect all ecosystem participants from error, neglect, and malice, no matter what the triggering event.  The appeal process is here for you.  To protect you.  Everybody from the experienced grant applicant to the newest dao member stands to benefit from a robust reliable and neutral appeals process. &#x20;
