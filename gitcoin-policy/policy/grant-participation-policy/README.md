# Grant Participation Policy

The current rules come from the [Gitcoin Holdings Inc. Terms of Service](https://gitcoin.co/legal/terms) and the established norms of the community. The next step in progressively decentralizing is to have the stewards of GitcoinDAO ratify the entirety of this policy.

New grants are all reviewed prior to being activated on the platform. Grants are evaluated for both their platform eligibility and for participation in the rounds they select.

**There are multiple levels for approval.**

Platform \| Ecosystem \| Round \| Collection

At each level, the participation policy allows for a subset of the grants at the higher level.
