# The Grant Approval Process

Any user \(logged into Gitcoin using their Github credentials\) can create a new grant. The grant is visible to the community but not active in the round, and thus not eligible for matching funds. The Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream of GitcoinDAO reviews each grant, approving or denying it. The verification process flow is below.

In the past, the Gitcoin Team has sole review responsibility. For the first time in GR10 the community was incorporated into the verification process, along with a way for denied grants to appeal the communityâ€™s decision.
