# The Gitcoin Mission

Our mission is to empower communities to build and fund digital public goods. We do that by giving builders opportunities to earn in a number of ways, including sponsored hackathons, ongoing bounties, and quarterly Grants rounds. In particular, Grants rounds are among our most significant economic vehicles. And because of the Quadratic Funding mechanism, they offer the community extraordinary involvement in deciding the allocation of public funds.
