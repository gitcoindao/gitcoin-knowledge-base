# Trustbonus

#### TrustBonus

**TrustBonus is designed to prevent sybil attacks by incentivizing identity verification**.

This round Gitcoin supported BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Idena, ENS Twitter, POAP, SMS, and Google as optional identity verification techniques. When a user verified their identity on other platforms, they were given a [TrustBonus](http://gitcoin.co/trust).

The higher the Trust Bonus of a user is, the more we can be confident that the user is real. Higher TrustBonuses come with benefits such as higher a match for grant contributions.

Given the increasing number of sybil attacks we’ve seen from round to round, we are strongly considering taking TrustBonus and Making it a TrustRequirement next round — users will not get any matching for their donations until they verify their identity on other platforms.
