# Identity Requirements

Any contribution that can be converted to USDT will be matched during an active match round. It will be matched as from a new unique contributor provided

1. It is from a new identity that has not contributed before.
2. Identity requirements continue to evolve but for Round 5 a unique identity = a Github account that is older than the CLR round.
3. Identity requirements are subject to the pretense that a contribution is not a Sybil attack or collusion.
