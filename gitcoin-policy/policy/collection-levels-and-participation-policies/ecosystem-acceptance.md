# Ecosystem Acceptance

A subset of grants supported by a continuous matching pool. The ecosystem establishes their own norms & values.

To use the Gitcoin Grants platform, the GitcoinDAO must approve of the ecosystem who is providing matching funding to a self-curated collection of grants. **This requires ratification by Steward Vote.**

The Ethereum ecosystem is the one our quarterly grants rounds currently focus on. This ecosystem is supporting many open source software developers/orgs and creators who promote the building on or of Ethereum.

The Ethereum ecosystem has also formed a split governance where the community multi-sig holders verify the work of GitcoinDAO as a check and balance. The GitcoinDAO is tasked with upholding the norms & values of the ecosystem.
