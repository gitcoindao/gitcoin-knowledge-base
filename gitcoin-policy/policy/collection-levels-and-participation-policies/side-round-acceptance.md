# Side-Round Acceptance

A separate ecosystem using the hype of a larger round to promote an unrelated round. “Gitcoin Building Gitcoin” during GR10 - Funds for matching provided by Gitcoin Holdings, therefore they set the Ecosystem and Round participation policy.

The GitcoinDAO stewards need to ratify the round per usual, but by identifying it as a "side-round" it notifies the explicit intent to piggyback on the larger ecosystem.
