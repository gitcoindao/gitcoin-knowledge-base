# Collection Levels & Participation Policies

Think of the Platform as all of the grants that exist. If a grant is not allowed on the platform, it won't be approved for matching in any collection.

There are two primary types of collections. They

1. **Ecosystem** - Subset of "All Grants on Platform". Has it's own matching pool & policy.
2. **Discovery** - Subset of grants in an Ecosystem. Can be given its own matching if the ecosystem allows for it.
   * **Sub-Rounds** like Infra, Dapp, Community are Discovery collections in the Ethereum ecosystem which are allocated a portion of the total matching for the round.
   * **User Collections** can be made by any user to highlight grants they think need to be supported.
